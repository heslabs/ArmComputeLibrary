### Arm Compute Library (ACL)
* A Software Library for Machine Learning
* https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/embedded-and-software/compute-library
* Arm Compute Library (ACL) is a key component of Arm Kleidi, which brings together the latest developer enablement technologies and critical developer resources to accelerate AI development and enhance performance across Arm-based platforms.
* ACL provides a comprehensive set of low-level machine learning functions optimized for Arm Cortex-A CPU, Arm Neoverse, and Arm Mali GPU architectures, to facilitate superior ML performance.
* The library is open-source software available under a permissive MIT license.
* The Arm Compute Library provides superior performance to other open-source alternatives and immediate support for new Arm technologies and architecture features, including SVE2 and SME2.

### Key Features:
* Over 100 machine learning functions for CPU and GPU
* Multiple convolution algorithms (GEMM, Winograd, FFT and Direct)
* Support for multiple data types: FP32, FP16, int8, uint8, BFloat16
* Micro-architecture optimization for key ML primitives
* Highly configurable build options enabling lightweight binaries
* Advanced optimization techniques such as Kernel Fusion, fast math enablement and texture utilization
* Device-and workload-specific tuning using the Open CL tuner and GEMM-optimized heuristics
